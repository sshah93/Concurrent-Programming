Assignment 4

Assignment Folder Structure:

Folders: v0, v1, v2, v3 and v4
Files: Time Analysis.docx & README.txt

v0 - Contains the source code files provided by the professor. 

v1 - Contains the source code files for version 1 of the assignment. This version makes 2 threads, a producer and a consumer thread.

v2 - Contains the source code files for version 2 of the assignment. This version makes a cached thread pool of consumers and synchronizes the countToken method.

v3 - Contains the source code files for version 3 of the assignment. This version makes a ConcurrentHashMap to improve concurrency.

v4 - Contains the source code files for version 4 of the assignment. This version makes a set of concurrent hash map where each consumer thread updates its own private concurrent hash map.

Time Analysis.docx - provides the run time for each version of the code and does the analysis requested by the professor

Each sub-folder (v0, v1, v2, v3 and v4) contains source files needed to build and run that version of the code. Each version has its own separate source files to make it easier for you (the grader).
